# Multi-Agent AI Press Conference Simulator

Welcome to the Press Conference Simulator! This project is a hands-on introduction to agentic AI, where you can orchestrate a simulated press conference with multiple AI agents playing different roles.

## üöÄ Educational Goals

This project demonstrates several key concepts in modern AI:

-   **Agentic AI**: See how different AI agents (`Spokesperson`, `Journalist`, `NoteTaker`, `Summarizer`) can be given unique roles and instructions to collaborate on a complex task.
-   **Prompt Engineering**: The behavior of each agent is guided by a specific prompt. You can explore `PressConferenceAgent/prompts.py` to see how we instruct the agents and experiment with changing their behavior.
-   **Controllable Personas**: By giving journalists a "bias" (e.g., left-leaning, right-leaning), you can see how the same underlying LLM can be guided to produce different styles of output.
-   **LLM Task Chaining**: This project uses a pipeline of LLM calls. The output of the main press conference (the transcript) becomes the input for the `NoteTaker`, and its output (the minutes) becomes the input for the `Summarizer`.

## üìÇ Codebase Overview

-   `orchestrator.py`: The main script you'll run to start the simulation.
-   `agents.py`: Defines the classes for each agent type.
-   `prompts.py`: Contains all the prompt templates that give the agents their instructions.
-   `event_scenarios.py`: A dictionary of news events that can be the subject of the press conference.
-   `visualize_press_conference.py`: A script to turn a finished transcript into an HTML file.
-   `produce_press_conference_audio.py`: A script to turn a finished transcript into an MP3 audio file.
-   `config.py` & `ollama_utils.py`: Configuration and helper files for using Ollama.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### 1. Prerequisites

-   **Ollama**: Ensure [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is installed and running.
-   **LLM Models**: Install at least one model via Ollama. We recommend `phi3`.
    ```bash
    ollama pull phi3
    ```
-   **Python Libraries**: Install `gTTS` for the audio generation feature.
    ```bash
    pip install gTTS
    ```

### 2. Running the Simulation

Start the press conference by running the `orchestrator.py` script:

```bash
python PressConferenceAgent/orchestrator.py
```

The script will guide you through an interactive setup:

1.  **Choose an Event**: Select a news scenario for the press conference.
2.  **Set Number of Journalists**: Decide how many journalists will ask questions.
3.  **Configure Journalists**: For each journalist, specify their **bias** (e.g., `left-leaning`) and the **Ollama model** they should use.
4.  **Configure Other Agents**: Select the models for the Spokesperson, Note-Taker, and Summarizer.
5.  **Set Number of Rounds**: Choose how many rounds of questions will occur.

### 3. Viewing the Results

After the simulation, a new folder is created in `PressConferenceAgent/results/`. Inside, you'll find:

-   `transcript.jsonl`: The raw log of every message and event.
-   `metadata.json`: The configuration you chose for the run.
-   `minutes.txt`: The final meeting minutes generated by the Note-Taker.
-   `summary.txt`: The final summary generated by the Summarizer.

### 4. Visualizing the Conference

To view the press conference as a chat, run the visualization script on your results folder:

```bash
python PressConferenceAgent/visualize_press_conference.py PressConferenceAgent/results/your_results_folder_name
```

This creates a `conference_visualization.html` file in the folder. Open it in a browser to see the interactive transcript.

### 5. Listening to the Conference

To generate an audio narration of the press conference, run the audio script:

```bash
python PressConferenceAgent/produce_press_conference_audio.py PressConferenceAgent/results/your_results_folder_name
```

This creates a `conference_audio.mp3` file for you to listen to.
